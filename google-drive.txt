Google Drive: Free Cloud Storage for Personal Use


A safe place for all your files

o Store, share, and access your files from any device.
  Your first 15 GB of storage are free.

  employees use. It comes with Google Docs, Sheets, and 
  Slides — and works seamlessly with Microsoft Office.

  Keep photos, stories, designs, drawings, recordings, videos, 
  and more. Your first 15 GB of storage are free with a
  Google Account.

o See your stuff anywhere
  Your files in Drive can be reached from any smartphone,
  tablet, or computer. So wherever you go, your files follow.

o Share files and folders
  You can quickly invite others to view, download, and
  collaborate on all the files you want–no email attachment
  needed.
